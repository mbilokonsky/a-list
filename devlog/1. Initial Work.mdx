## Things Done

1. Auth flow

- unauthenticated vs authenticated pages in phoenix
- hilarious sign-in logic for now

2. Data Architecture

- design schema
  - ListTemplate, ListItem, List, Thing, Author

3. Lessons Learned

- Order of operations matters. I need to design the schema first, then do all migrations in order, then generate user interface stuff.
